                <h3>What is the Meaning of Life?</h3>

                <p>
                No one can tell the actual definition of the meaning of life. For some, it is all about happiness, building a family, and leading life as it is. For some, it is about accumulating wealth, whereas, for some, it is all about love.

Many think about the meaning and purpose in life from a philosophical perspective, but the meaning in life is associated with better health, wellness, and perhaps longevity, suggests a new study.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                I’m still wondering this same thing… I’m so unhappy that it’s painful just to live. I cry a lot these days, have gone through depression many times. Every time I step out of my house, I seem to piss someone off by just walking by, labeled weird and all those mean words. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even make eye contact with people or oncoming traffic. I hate myself. I hate my life. It won’t get better, only harder.

                <h3>Is she ever coming back to me?</h3>

                <p>
                It takes 3 weeks for an average person to recover from a serious fight. Do not try to contact her. As she has blocked you from social networking sites, you have even lesser ways to try and contact her, which is a good thing.

Concentrate on your life. I know it is difficult to concentrate when all you can think about is her. But do it anyway. Challenge yourself to gain/lose weight, start working out, start learning new things that interest you - music/dance/art.

If you cannot think of anything else, binge watch TV series, plan weekend activities with friends, socialize. Keep yourself as busy as you can.

Remember that she has your contact details. Whenever she wants to contact you, she can do that. So do not worry.

                <h3>Will i ever feel complete again?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                Yes you can feel whole again. Yes you will be loved again. No you are not so broken nobody wants you.

That being said you do need to work on you. Take time to find yourself. Build up you self confidence as nothing is more sexy and can capture a man's attention like self confidence.

Once you have self esteem, self awareness, self confidence, self love you will be unstoppable. The wonderful part about achieving all of those traits are once you are happy with yourself you will not need anyone to define you. Once you are happy and love yourself you realize that you yourself are enough and you wont pine after needing to have someone to make you complete. You will be complete just being you.
